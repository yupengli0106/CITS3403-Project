# **Let's Go History!**

The aim of this project is to promote people to learn about some significant historical events and timelines through games on our website. It may be more interesting to play web games than to read boring textbooks. Players are randomly matched to historical questions from the database, and then enter the time in which that historical event occurred. Our system records the user's score and ranks them accordingly. As a result, users will be more motivated to learn historical knowledge for higher rankings.
